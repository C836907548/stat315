p for “probability”, the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
q for “quantile”, the inverse CDF
d for “density”, the probability mass function (PMF)
r for “random”, a random variable having the specified distribution

binom (binomial), pois (Poisson), and geom (Geometric).

q = events
size = total
prob = probability. MAKE SURE ITS IN 0.05 format
lamba = lamba

@ at most / less than or equal

pbinom(q = 80, size = 100, prob = 0.733)
ppois(q=3,lambda=2)

@ at least / more than

1 - pbinom(q = x, size = size, prob = prob)
1 - ppois(q=950, lambda=1000)

@ exactly

dbinom(x=5,size=10,prob=0.5)

/////////////

 (d) What is the probability that X=8 in our sample? 

> mean(data ==8)

 (e) What is the probability that X is at least 8 in our sample? 

mean(data >= 8)

discrete
1,2,3
1,2,3,.....

continous
1, 1.1, ... , 3


Binomial = sum propa of many bernoulli/discrtete. many coin flips
Bernoulli = two outcome. one boolean. coin flip
Poisson = per hour. lambda. sandwhiches per hour
Discrete Uniform = n outcomes. equally likely. dice roll
